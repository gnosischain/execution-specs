# Documentation

The `execution-spec-tests` documentation is generated via [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and hosted remotely on Github Pages at [ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/).

## Prerequisites

```console
pip install -e .[docs]
```

## Build the Documentation

One time build:
```console
mkdocs build
```

### Local Deployment and Test
This runs continually and re-generates the documentation upon changes in the `./docs/` sub-director and deploys the site locally ([127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/), by default):

```console
mkdocs serve
```
Note: The `gen-files` plugin currently breaks the `serve` command by continually re-generating the documentation. Disable this config in mkdocs.yml to avoid this behaviour.

### Test Remote Deployment

This can be used to generate and deploy a local version of the documentation remotely on Github pages in order to share a preview with other developers. Note, as the documentation is generated locally, even changes that have not been pushed will be deployed:

```console
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

It will be deployed to the Github pages of the repo's username (branch is ignored), e.g., [https://danceratopz.github.io/execution-spec-tests](https://danceratopz.github.io/execution-spec-tests).

## Implementation

### Plugins

The documentation flow uses `mkdocs` and the following additional plugins:

- [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/): The main doc generation tool.
- [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material): Provides many additional features and styling for mkdocs.
- [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) and [mkdocstrings-python](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/): To generate documentation from Python docstrings.
- [mkdocs-gen-files](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files): To generate markdown files automatically for each test case Python module. See [this page](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/crystal/quickstart/migrate.html) for example usage. This plugin is used to [programmatically generate the nav section](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files/extras.html) for the generated test case reference documentation.
- [mkdocs-literate-nav](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-literate-nav/index.html): Is used to define the navigation layout for non-generated content and was created to work well with `mkdocs-gen-files` to add nav content for generated content.
- [mkdocs-git-authors-plugin](https://timvink.github.io/mkdocs-git-authors-plugin/): To display doc contributors in the page footer.
- [mkdocs-glightbox](https://github.com/blueswen/mkdocs-glightbox) - for improved image and inline content display.


### The "Test Case Reference" Section

This section is auto-generated via a combination of:

1. [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) and [mkdocstrings-python](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/),
2. [mkdocs-gen-files](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files),
3. [mkdocs-literate-nav](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-literate-nav/index.html).

It auto-generates a sequence of nested pages (with nav entries) of all python modules detected under `./tests`. Each page contains a stub to the doc generated by mkdocstrings from the module's docstrings and source code. The mkdocs-gen-files and mkdocs-literate-nav plugins were created exactly for [this purpose](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/crystal/quickstart/migrate.html).

No action is necessary if a new test directory or module is added to `./tests`, it will be picked up automatically.

!!! info "Working with generated content"
    The files in the `./tests` directory are watched by `mkdocs serve`. Run `mkdocs serve` and edit the source docstrings: The browser will reload with the new content automatically.

### Navigation

All pages that are to be included in the documentation and the navigation bar must be included in `navigation.md`, except "Test Case Reference" entries. This is enabled by [mkdocs-literate-nav](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-literate-nav/index.html). The nav entries for the automatically generated "Test Case Reference" section are generated in [mkdocs-gen-files](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files) and appended to `navigation.md`.

!!! info "Current nav ordering limitations"
    The "Test Case Reference" section must currently be the last section in the nav. This is because our mkdocs flow:

    1. Reads `navigation.md`.
    2. Generates the Test Case Reference documentation and appends the Test Case Reference entries to `navigation.md`
    3. Generates the nav.

    If necessary, we could probably split `navigation.md` into two files
    
    - `navigation-pre-test-case-reference.md`,
    - `navigation-post-test-case-reference.md`,

    and create an arbitrary ordering in the Test Case Reference doc gen script. But this is untested.
