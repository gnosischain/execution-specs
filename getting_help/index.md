# Getting Help

The tests in this repository are a community effort to help improve the development cycle of all Ethereum execution clients.

We encourage contributions and recognize that Python is not everyone's  primary language - if you stumble over issues or need help, please reach out to one of the execution-spec-tests maintainers either directly or in the `#testing` channel in the [Ethereum R&D Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/qGpsxSA).
